# MyOTA participant web

MyOTA is a programme-agnostic platform for outdoor activation programmes. MPOTA is represented as a configured programme, not as the platform itself. No rules or charter text are copied from POTA or any other programme: every programme supplies its own configuration, policy, eligibility, awards and public charter.

This repository owns the public, participant-facing browser experience. It is
separate from myota-admin-web: administration, moderation, imports, programme
editing, and role management stay in the web control plane.

## What works now

- Programme switching and programme-provided theme/content.
- Approved/candidate map distinction with interactive Sevilla sample data.
- Entity and programme browsing foundations.
- Participant sign-in, published award progress, and hunter/activator level requests.
- Interactive Sevilla sample map using visible OpenStreetMap attribution, drag panning, and zoom controls.
- Published programme awards with hunter/activator levels, server-side progress checks, participant sign-in, and award-level requests.
- OpenAPI and event contracts, ADRs, migration notes, health endpoints and local deployment manifests.

The current public experience is not yet the complete launch product. The next
participant milestones are the Explorer landing page, nearby search, entity
details, proposals, activation/QSO workflows, public activation history,
privacy-aware leaderboards, and production account/profile flows. They are
tracked in the [charter gap analysis](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/charter-gap-analysis.md)
and the [organization roadmap](https://github.com/myota-platform/.github/tree/main/profile).

## Run the vertical slice

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 services/dev_server.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. The local harness is dependency-light; for
durable data use the Compose stack in myota-deploy with Colima.

The web client renders policy supplied by each programme. It does not copy
POTA/MPOTA rules or decide eligibility in the browser. MPOTA is sample data
only. Android and iOS roadmap work has the same participant-only scope; admin
workflows remain web-only.

## Architecture

Read the [project charter](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/project-charter.md)
and [repository map](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/repository-map.md)
for product motivation and ownership boundaries.

## Source project

The original `ea7klk/mpota` repository remains untouched. Its charter and planned flows are treated as the migration source; see [`docs/migration-from-mpota.md`](docs/migration-from-mpota.md).
